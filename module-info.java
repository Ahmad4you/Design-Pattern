/**

 * Creational Patterns:
Singleton: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
Factory: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter 
the type of objects that will be created.
Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same 
construction process to create various representations.

*Structural Patterns:
Adapter: Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface, enabling classes 
with incompatible interfaces to work together.
Composite: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients 
to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
Decorator: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects by placing them inside special wrapper objects 
that extend their capabilities.

*Behavioral Patterns:
Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, 
all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, 
allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses, 
allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without 
changing the algorithm's structure.
